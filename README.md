# Imperative Coursework
# cw1 - Triangles
Quite a simple coursework for examining triangles and deciding the properties of them - equilateral, isosceles, scalene, etc. 
# cw1 - Visualiser
A program that examines the values given to it and displays them in their binary form. Allows them to be represented as signed and unsigned ints, longs, chars, and floats.
# cw2 - List
Implements a Pointer List datatype in C. 
# cw2 - Network
Implements a Graph datatype in C. Allows you to create graphs by adding and deleting vertices and edges, as well as use DFS and BFS to search through them as well as Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate distances.
# cw3 - Sketch
Takes in sketch (.sk) files as input and displays them onto a sdl2 display window. Sketch files operate by loading in target co-ordinates onto before drawing lines or boxes between them, as well as setting colours and performing animations.
# cw3 - Converter
This program takes in PGM image files and converts them into .sk files. It does this by performing 2D run length encoding, selecting rectangular regions of same-coloured pixels and allowing them to be drawn as blocks in the .sk file.
